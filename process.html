        <h2>Methodologies</h2>

        <p>Using full-cycle development means everyone takes responsibility for the project. Starting with idea elaboration,
            system specifications and user experience design we follow the latest industry standards and practices to guarantee
            that our clients get something unique and effective. Something that grows their business and brings it to a whole new level.

        <h3>Agile</h3>
        <p>We utilise Agile methodologies to optimise team efficiency to ensure communication, staffing,
            resource assignment and reporting are all completed effectively.

    <div class="fourth subsection">
      <h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
        <p>Modern applications and software needs updating and tweaking to adapt to the ever changing environment.
            Because integration takes place so frequently, in continuous integration there is significantly less back-tracking
            to discover where things went wrong, so you can spend more time building features.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we didn't follow a continuous approach, we would have longer periods between integrations this would make it
            exponentially more difficult to find and fix problems. Such integration problems can easily knock a project off-schedule,
            or cause it to fail altogether.
