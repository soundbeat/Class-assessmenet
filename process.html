      <h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
        <p>Modern applications and software needs updating and tweaking to adapt to the ever changing environment.
            Because integration takes place so frequently, in continuous integration there is significantly less back-tracking
            to discover where things went wrong, so you can spend more time building features.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we didn't follow a continuous approach, we would have longer periods between integrations this would make it
            exponentially more difficult to find and fix problems. Such integration problems can easily knock a project off-schedule,
            or cause it to fail altogether.
