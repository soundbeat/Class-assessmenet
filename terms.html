        <h2>Acceptance of Work</h2>
        <p>- Quotations are valid for 30 days from date of issue.
            - When the Client places an order to purchase a website or website updates from the Developer, the order represents
            an offer to the Developer to purchase the website or website updates. No contract for the supply of services exists
            between Client and Developer until the Developer sends an invoice to the Client for payment. The invoice equals acceptance
            by the Developer (or third party supplier) of the Client's offer to purchase services from the Developer and this acceptance
            of work is a valid contract between Client and Developer regardless of whether the Client receives the invoice.
            - Any other services on the order that have not been included in the invoice do not form part of the contract.
            The Client agrees to check that the details of the invoice are correct and should print and keep a copy for their records.
            - The Developer is liable to withdraw the from contract at any time prior to acceptance.
            - Additional work requested by the Client that is not specified in the agreed quotation is subject to an additional quotation
            by the Developer on receipt of specification. If the work is needed as part of an existing project, then this may affect time
            scale and overall delivery time of the project.
            - If a functional specification and a set of testing criteria is included within the quotation, the Developer is responsible for
            fulfilling the testing criteria as the sole criteria for completion of the contract.
            - The Client agrees that the standard development platform is an agreeable platform for development of the website and all
            acceptance testing will occur only on the standard development platform. The Client further agrees that any requests relating
            to hardware or software outside the standard development platform will be deemed additional work.
            - The Client agrees to provide any needed information and content required by the Developer in good time to enable the Developer
            to complete a design or website work as part of an agreed project.
            - Any work is subject to a minimum charge of &pound;90.
        </p>

        <p>- Copyright of the completed web designs, images, pages, code and source files created by the Developer for the project shall be with
            the Client upon final payment only by prior written agreement. Without agreement, ownership of designs and all code is with the Developer.
            - These terms of use grant a non-exclusive limited license so that the Client can use the design on one website on one domain name only.

            and the Developer.
            - The Client hereby agrees that all media and content made available to the Developer for use in the project are either owned by the Client or

            that may arise as a result of using the supplied media and content.
            - The Client agrees that the Developer may include development credits and links within any code the Developer designs, builds or amends.
            If the Developer designs a website for a Client, then the Client agrees that the Developer may include a development credit and link displayed on

                <p>- The Developer can, at its own discretion, but is not obliged to, offer domain name registration and hosting via a third party service.
                    - The Client agrees that registration of a domain name does not provide endorsement of the right to use the name. The Client is responsible
                    for ensuring they have due title to the domain name. The Developer holds no liability and the Client hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
                    the Developer from any claim resulting from the Client's registration of a domain name.
                    - The domain name is registered in the Client's own name, with the address and contact details of the Developer. The Client should be aware that a
                    domain name is registered with a third party and as such the Client shall agree to fully abide by the terms and conditions set out by the third party for such services.
                    - The Client agrees to take all legal responsibility for use of third party domain name and hosting services and supply truthful details to the third party services.
                    - The Client agrees that information submitted for registration of domain names is then available to the general public via the Nominet Whois system. However,
                    Clients who are using their website for non-trading purposes may ask the third party registrar for their contact information not to be included in the Nominet Whois system.
                    - The Client is liable to pay the Developer for any domain name registrations and the initial set-up of the hosting if included as part of the website build.
                    - Any support relating to the domain name, hosting and email services is between the Client and the third party service.
                    - Any other domain name and hosting services or costs not included by the Developer, including but not limited to further domain name registration fees,
                    domain name transfer charges, yearly domain name renewals, hosting charges, yearly hosting renewals, hosting upgrades, extra disk space, bandwidth and any other
                    related or hidden charges, are to be paid by the Client to the third party services.
                    - The Client agrees to pay the domain name and hosting fees as soon as required by the third party. Any modifications needed to the domain name or hosting services are

                    - The Client agrees that if at any time their contact details, including email address, change, it is their responsibility to contact the third party and update their
                    contact details. Failure to do so may mean that renewal invoices for the domain name and hosting services are not received by the Client.
                    - Payment for domain name and hosting services is to be made immediately on receipt of an invoice from the third party service. Failure to comply with the payment terms
                    may result in the Client's domain name becoming available to another party and/or the website and email services becoming unavailable.
                    - The Client agrees to pass on FTP details and any other access details relating to their domain name and hosting account that the Developer requires to upload the website
                    if required as part of a project.

                    <h2>Projects</h2>
                    <p>- The Client agrees that an HTML page built from a graphic design may not exactly match the original design because of the difference between the display in
                        design software and the rendering of HTML code by Internet browser software. The Developer agrees to try to match the design as closely as is possible when building the code.
                        - During a website project it is important that the Client communicates information to the Developer to achieve the required result.
                        - The Client agrees they are permitted a maximum of 4 hours of alteration on projects of &pound;3000, with an additional 1 hour of alteration available per

                        After the allocated time for alterations is used up, either in design or coding, the Developer reserves the right to advise the Client of such and send a separate
                        quotation to the Client and to request payment for any further alterations. The Developer reserves the right to request payment be received for further alterations
                        before continuing work. Upon completion of agreed design, the Client is asked to confirm in writing by email or postal mail that the design and the screen size is
                        signed off as complete and agree that any further design alterations are chargeable.
                        - If the Client requests design or content alterations to pages that have already been completed, new pages or different functionality other than that specified in
                        the original quotation, the Developer reserves the right to quote separately for these alterations.
                        - If optimised pages are included as part of the project, the Developer will optimise the Client's web pages that already make up part of the project. Optimised pages
                        is not creation of new pages. The optimisation of the web pages can include the meta tags, keywords, description, title, alternative text and other text provided by the Client.
                        - The Developer endeavours to create pages that are accessible to search engines. However, the Developer gives no guarantee that the site will become listed with search engines.
                        - If an error or issue with the design or code arises during the project, which does not allow the design or code to match the original specification, then the Client
                        agrees that the Developer can apply a nearest available alternative solution.
                        - The Developer at all times applies reasonable skill and care in provision of services.
                        - On request, the Developer can create a copy of the website on one CD to be posted to the Client on project completion. A small charge will be made to cover the cost
                        of this, unless quoted otherwise.
                        - Once the project is completed, the Developer will upload the website to the Client's live web address if included as part of a project.
                        - After site completion, a Client or a third party of their choosing may wish to edit their website code themselves to make updates. However, the Client agrees that in
                        so doing they assume full responsibility for any issues which occur as a result of changing the code themselves. If the Client or a third party of their choosing edits the
                        website code and this results in functionality errors or the page displaying incorrectly, then the Developer reserves the right to quote for work to repair the website.
                        - The Developer reserves the right to assign subcontractors in whole or as part of a project if needed.
                        - The Developer will keep a copy of the site and design source files when a website project is being worked on. However, the Client agrees that it is their responsibility
                        to have regular backups made by themselves or the third party hosting services in case of a software or hardware failure at the third party hosting servers.
                        - All communications between Developer and Client shall be by telephone, email, Skype or postal mail, except where agreed at the Developer's discretion.
